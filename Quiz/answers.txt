1. What is JWT and how does it work ?

JSON Web Token (JWT) is an open standard that defines a compact and self-contained way for securely transmitting information between parties as a JSON object. 
When a user logs into a web app, a token is generated. This token contains the user id and acts as a key which authenticates and authorize user activities on a web app.

2. Explain the difference between cookies and tokens in web development.

Tokens are used to send authorization data whereas cookies are used to store and send raw data.

3. How can you secure JWT tokens from being tampered with or decoded ?

i. Give tokens an expiration.
ii. Use HTTPS connections only.
iii. Store and reuse tokens.
iv. Implimenting 2-factor authentication
v. Keep your token secret.

4. What are the advantages of using JWT over traditional session - based authentication ?

i. Stateless and scalable architecture requirements.
ii. APIs, microservices, and decentralized systems.
iii. Cross-domain authentication and reduced communication overhead.

5. How does the concept of statelessness apply to JWT authentication ?

JWT authentication is stateless because it sends requests to the server and relays the response back without storing any information. 

6. What are the common security risks associated with using cookies for authentication ?

Because cookies store and sends data which is the user authentication credentials, hacker can gain access and manipulate the data.

7. How can you implement token - based authentication in a Node.js Express server ?

8. Explain the process of token validation in a Node.js Express server.
9. How can you handle token expiration and renewal in a Node.js Express server ?
10. Discuss the best practices for storing and managing JWT tokens securely in a web application.
